# HelloPMD
A sample project to showcase the capabilities of PMD (source code analyzer)

# Setup schema for PMD rules (Optional)
Since the schemaLocation doesn't seem to work -- which means that the following schema location attribute won't load 
the schema file:

> xsi:schemaLocation="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/ruleset/2.0.0 https://pmd.sourceforge.net/ruleset_2_0_0.xsd"

We could (*optionally*) set up the XML catalog in Eclipse to make the schema assistant work.
1. Select "Window -> Preferences" to open the Preferences dialog.
1. In the navigation tree expand the "XML -> XML Catalog".
1. Select "User Specified Entries" and click the "Add" button to add a User Specified Entry.
1. Set "Location" to be the actual schema file, i.e. "HelloPMD/shcema/ruleset_2_0_0.xsd", and set "Key type" to be "Namespace name", "Key" to be "http://pmd.sourceforge.net/ruleset/2.0.0".
1. Click "OK" and "Apply" button to make this new XML Catalo entry work.

Note that the schema file here is exracted from pmd-core.jar/ruleset_2_0_0.xsd.

# Install PMD Plugin for Eclipse (Optional)
You don't need to install the plugin for Eclipse (the standalone CLI tool would be good enough). But if you really want to, read along.

To install the PMD plugin for Eclipse:
1. Start Eclipse and open a project
2. Select "Helpï¿½ -> Software Updates -> ind and Install"
3. Click "Next", then click "New remote site"
4. Enter "PMD" into the Name field and https://dl.bintray.com/pmd/pmd-eclipse-plugin/updates/ into the URL field
5. Click through the rest of the dialog boxes to install the plugin

# Add PMD Library
You might also add the PMD library as dependency for this project, in order to invoke PMD directly in the code.
1. Select "Windows" -> "Preferences", locate to "Java -> Build Path" -> "User Libraries";
2. CLick "New" button to add a new user library, set up a name like "PMD";
3. Click "Add External JARS" to import all those Jar files in the PMD "lib" directory
4. Click "Aply and Close", then add this user library into current project's Libraries list.

# How to set the custom PMD
1. Select the target project -> right click -> properties
2. Find the PMD -> enable PMD -> use the ruleset configured in a project file -> choose custom PMD ruleset

Note: Before setting the custom PMD, please make sure you have already disabled the global configuration for PMD
Window -> Properties -> PMD -> rule configuration -> uncheck the "Use global role management"

# Two ways to run the PMD
1. For the single file: right click in this file-> PMD -> check code
2. For the whole project: open project Explorer -> right click the target project -> PMD -> check code

# .gitignore list
* _/bin/_ the classes directory for current project
* _/local-only/_ you can put any local files here, i.e. local PMD scripts, local configurations, etc.
* _pmd-cache_ Enable PMD cache by add "-cache pmd-cache" as the argument fed to PMD. Refer to PMD CLI Reference for details.
